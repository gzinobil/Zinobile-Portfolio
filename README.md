# Zinobile-Portfolio
Telling Stories with Data Spring 2019

# About me
Hell0, my name is Gabrielle Zinobile and I am a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. 

# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to create and improve my data storytelling skills. I will be entering the consulting world 
last this year and I know I will be accountable for delivering stimulating and easily digestable content to my clients. I also 
hope to learn more about different tools and what you can do with each. 

Before coming to Heinz, I spent over five yearsworking for non-profits. My background is in non-profit fundraising, marketing, and program delivery within the health care, education, and community development sectors. In each of these roles, 
I worked with varying levels of organizational staff and stakeholders by preparing slide decks, 
financial reports, and program evaluation one-pagers. But, because my undergraduate degress
was in biology and environmental science, I struggled to present the information in a median where all could
digest it.
